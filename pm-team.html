            <h4>Is this your story?</h4><br/>
            <p><strong>⭐ You built a great product that clearly solves a pain for its customers - congratulations!</strong> This is an extremely hard achievement and most startups fail before getting any love from its users. You may have now raised funding to start hiring more people and continue to create the organization that will make your vision come true.
            <p><strong>🌊 But it's so overwhelming, right? Having to run your entire business and still be involved in the defining all product details, day-to-day engineering execution, customer development, etc...</strong> Yeah, it might be time to create your product team. But I understand it's hard to find someone else to pass the ball to. How to even get started?</p>
            
            <h4>I can help you</h4><br/>
            <p><strong>🙋 Most of my advising work in the past 5 years was helping startups facing this exact challenge. </strong> With a structured framework and hands-on support from me, you will get clarity about the next steps in hiring, training, growing and operating your team. </p>
            <p><strong>👨‍👩‍👦  Companies that I've worked with were able to endure the growing pains and navigate smoothly through this exciting phase</strong>. Moreover, the new team was formed with a strong product culture from the get-go, building a solid foundation for the years ahead. 
            <p><strong>📈 For example, I supported Levee when the product work was all handled by the founder</strong>. I helped them think about how to grow and organize the team, leveraging the learnings I had with my work in Sillicon Valley. Levee now has many PMs in the company, dozens of engineers and have already raised several funding rounds. Through my advisory work to startups invested by Monashees, I was able to support many companies in a similar trajectory.</strong></p>
